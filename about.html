<h1>About</h1>

<p>When writing stories as an emerging journalist, I always look back at my roots for inspiration to see how much I've grown and to give myself perspective on the road ahead. Below is a brief timeline of my upbringing from my childhood to the present day.

<h2> Upbringing </h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Silver Spring Maryland, and have always held a love for the state of which I was born. My mother, Patricia, was raised just down the road in Takoma Park, while my father, Bruce, hails from the great state of Michigan. Throughout my childhood, I developed a love for sports through playing football in my front yard with my cousin and neighbor, Ben (on the left in the attached picture). Ben had a tremendous impact on my life, as a child leukemia patient he taught me always to keep a positive mindset, and to never stop working for the things you love. When Ben passed away in 2009, I vowed to give life my all, which is why I'm pursuing sports journalism today.</p>

<h2> Early Career </h2>
<p>I first developed a love for sports journalism in elementary school, when I would play "Webkinz Soccer" with my stuffed animals in my basement. Sneaking on to my mom's computer in the evenings, I would write out game recaps on " The Ferguson Times", my own personal newspaper, located on a Word document. My passion for sports writing endured past my stuffed animal phase, as I joined my high school newspaper to cover sports during my senior year at James Hubert Blake High School. After taking my first journalism class, I decided to pursue it as a career path at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park in the Fall of 2019.</p>

<h2>Current</h2>

<p>Right as I arrived on the grounds of College Park, I hit the ground running. Signing up for the campus radio station in the Fall of 2019, I was able to call multiple wrestling matches live on air for WMUC Sports. Since then, I've called sporting events for a plethora of different athletic programs. As a sophomore, I was hired as a sports writer at The Diamondback, an independent newspaper covering the university. On the sports desk, I was assigned the Women's Volleyball beat, a position I proudly still hold to this day. And this past summer, after managing a local pool for three months, I was brought on as the managing editor of The Left Bench, another sports publication on campus in College Park. By writing, editing, and broadcasting a variety of sporting events, I've been able to widen my knowledge about the sports journalism industry and its committments.</p>
